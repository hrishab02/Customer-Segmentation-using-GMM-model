# Customer-Segmentation-using-GMM-model
A data analysis technique that helps businesses categorize their customer base into distinct groups based on
shared characteristics. This method utilizes a probabilistic model called a Gaussian Mixture Model to identify
patterns and relationships within the data. â€¢The GMM algorithm will then group customers into clusters based
on the similarity of their visual features. Each cluster represents a segment of customers who share common
characteristics.
